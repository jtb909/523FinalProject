### Database Concepts and Applications Final Project

The purpose of this project was to develop a relational database for an interior design company, which was broken down into 3 separate phases.

### Phase 1 - Database Design
The database design phase of the project involved creating an entity relationship model, schema, and data dictionary based upon the information given about the interior design company in relation to the specifications of the project.

### Phase 2 - Database Development

The database development phase of the project involved migrating the contents of the schema into SQL to begin building the database.

After creating each of the tables and attributes in SQL, records were then added to the database for each client, designer, job, inspection, type(s) of work done by contractors, contractor information, and tasks.

### Phase 3 - Testing the Database

The database was then tested by executing queries to ensure that it was functioning as expected. 

### Opening the Database:
To open and view the database, download the .db file from this repository and open it with your preferred database management software.
